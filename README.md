Connect 4
___________________________________________________________________________
This project was made for my AI class. We built a clone of connect 4 that you play against a AI. The program language we used was Python. The algorithms that we used were Alpha-Beta Pruning and Minimax.
We choose Minimax as our AI's decision-making bot. It works by thinking ahead and considering all possible future moves and choosing the one that offers the best chance of success. Alpha-Beta Pruning was chosen to make sure it's always one step ahead of the player making sure its always has a higher score than the player.
